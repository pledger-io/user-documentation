Asset accounts are those that are owned by you.
These can for example be banking accounts, credit cards or petty cash.

== Managing accounts

You can list all the regular accounts by clicking on the `Checking accounts` option in the side-bar navigation.
This will open the account overview page with all the accounts that you have.

=== Creating an account

Creating or editing accounts can be done by either clicking the `Add account` button in the top of the overview page or by clicking the icon:square-edit[] icon in the context menu.
You will be presented a form which allows you to enter all the account information.

.The account form

On this form the following fields are mandatory:

- `Name`, enter a descriptive name for the account
- `Currency`, select one of the available currencies
- `Type`, the type of account you wish

== Reconcile an account

Account reconciliation can be used to correct any missing funds or transactions in {application}.
You can do this using a yearly bank statement you receive from your bank.
{application} will then add a transaction correction to match the years end balance with your bank statement.

You start an account reconciliation by clicking the icon:balance-scale[] icon in the context menu of the account you wish to reconcile.
This will open a reconciliation form.

In this form enter the year you wish to perform the reconciliation for as well as the opening and closing
balance as indicated by your bank statement. Once you `Save` the reconciliation Personal Ledger will compare the
opening and closing balance.

If the accounts closing balance is off then {application} will automatically create a new transaction with the difference between the bank statement, and the recorded balance.
If the opening balance differs then {application} will not complete the reconciliation.
The previous year should be reconciled before you can continue.

=== Correcting opening balance

When account reconciliation fails due to a mismatch in opening balances you will be presented with the reconciliation overview.
This is displayed on the `Checking accounts` overview page below the list of accounts.

You can now either correct the opening balance manually.
By creating a new transaction with the difference, or start an account reconciliation for the previous year by clicking the icon:hammer[] icon.
Once the previous year is reconciled {application} will automatically resume the incomplete account reconciliation as well.

If you have chosen to enter a manual correction then you can click the icon:retry[] icon to retry the account reconciliation.
