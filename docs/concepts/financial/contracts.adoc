In {application} contracts are agreements between two or more parties to do something for each other.

== What are contracts in finance?

Imagine you and your friend want to trade something valuable, like toys.
You both want to make sure the trade is fair and everyone keeps their promises.
So, you decide to write down what each of you will give and get in a piece of paper.
That piece of paper is like a contract.

Now, in a financial bookkeeping system, contracts are kind of like those papers.
When businesses or people agree to do something for each other, like buying or selling goods, lending money, or providing services, they write down the terms of their agreement in a contract.
This helps everyone involved remember what they agreed to and makes sure everyone sticks to their promises.

== Why are contracts important in finance?

In the bookkeeping system, contracts are important because they record the transactions between different parties.
These transactions can involve money, goods, services, or anything else of value.
By keeping track of contracts, businesses can stay organized, make sure they get paid for what they do, and make sure they fulfill their obligations to others.
It's like a written agreement that helps keep everything running smoothly and fairly in the world of finance.
