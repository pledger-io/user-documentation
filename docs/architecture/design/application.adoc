{application} is a web application that consists out of several repositories.
Each of the repositories has a dedicated goal and is designed to be bundled into a single application.

== Involved repositories

At this point in time, the following repositories are available:

*Code repositories*

* link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/fintrack-application/src[fintrack-application],
    the main application repository containing the Java REST-api.
* link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/user-interface/src[user-interface],
    the React based user interface.
* link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/fintrack-deployment/src[fintrack-deployment],
    the deployment repository bundling the user-interface and fintrack-application artifacts.

*Documentation repositories*

* link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/user-documentation/src[user-documentation],
    the repository that generates this website.
* link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/fintrack-importer-configuration/src[fintrack-importer-configuration],
    the repository containing default configuration for the CSV based transaction importer.

== REST-api

The REST-api is the main component of the application.
This part of {application} is build using the following tooling:

- link:https://gradle.org/[Gradle],
    used as the build tool.
- link:https://micronaut.io/[Micronaut framework],
    used as the DI and API framework.
- link:https://camunda.com/[Camunda BPM],
    used to automate workflows inside {application}.

=== Internal design

The REST-api is designed to be a stateless application.
Inside this part of the application several layers are recognized:

- The `REST-api layer`, which is the entry point for all requests.
- The `Application domain` layer, which contains the business logic.
- The `Business Process layer`, which contains the workflow logic and is based on Camunda BPM.
- The `JPA database layer`, which contains the database access logic.

In this design the `Application domain` layer does not directly communicate with any of the other layers.
If an action occurs on any of the entities in this layer an event is published on the internal event bus.
This event bus is provided by Micronaut and is only accessible inside the application.

== User interface

The user interface is a React based application.
It is build up using the following frameworks and tools:

- link:https://reactjs.org/[React],
    used as the UI framework.
- link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript],
    used as the programming language.
- link:https://www.chartjs.org/[Chart.js],
    used for the rendering of the various charts inside the application.
- link:https://axios-http.com/docs/intro[axios],
    used for the communication with the REST-api.

== Deployment

The deployment repository is used to bundle the user-interface and REST-api into a single deployable artifact.
This repository is build using the following tooling:

- link:https://gradle.org/[Gradle],
    used as the build tool.
- link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker],
    used to create the docker images.
- link:https://www.electron.build/[Electron],
    used to create the desktop application.

=== Build process

.Build process
image::architecture/application-build-process.png[]

1. Pulling the latest version of the `user-interface` and `REST-api`.
2. Building an output archive for the combined REST-api and user-interface.
3. Building a `docker` image for the combined REST-api and user-interface.
4. Building an `electron application` for the combined REST-api and user-interface.
5. Pushing the docker image to the docker registry.
6. Pushing the desktop application to the release repository.
