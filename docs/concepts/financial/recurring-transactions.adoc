{application} allows you to create recurring transactions.
These are transactions that are automatically created at regular intervals.
For example, you can create a recurring transaction for your rent, which will be created every month.

Recurring transactions are useful for transactions that are repeated at regular intervals, such as rent, salaries, and utility bills.
They help you to manage your finances by automating the creation of these transactions.

Recurring transactions can be created for any type of transaction, such as expenses, income, and transfers.
