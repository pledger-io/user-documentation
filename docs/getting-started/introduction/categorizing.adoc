Recording transactions into {application} is the first step in managing your finances.
They are the records of money coming in and going out of your accounts.
Transactions can be categorized to help you understand where your money is going and where it is coming from.

This guide will show you how to create and categorize transactions in {application}.
The guide will not go into how to budget, but will show you how to categorize transactions using categories and tags.
Budgeting is covered in xref:{document-root}how-to/your-finances/budgeting.adoc[another guide].

NOTE: This guide assumes you have already xref:{document-root}/getting-started/introduction/first-account.adoc[set up your accounts] in {application}.

== Understanding how categories work

In {application}, transactions can be categorized in multiple ways:

* By using budgets, read xref:{document-root}/concepts/financial/budgets.adoc[here] to get insight into what budgets are.
* By using categories
* By using custom tags

Each of these methods can be used to categorize transactions in different ways.
A transaction can have exactly one budget, one category, and as many tags as you would like.

A budget could be considered the highest level of categorization, as it is used to group transactions into a specific expense groups you want to monitor.
The category is used to further categorize transactions within a budget.
Tags are used to add additional information to a transaction.

== Creating your categories

To get started with categorizing transactions, you need to create categories.
Navigate to the category overview page by clicking on the `Categories` in the sidebar.

To create a new category, click on the `Add new category` button.
This will open a new category form where you can enter the details of the new category.
On this form the following fields are required:

* `Name`: The name of the category.

TIP: Even though the description is optional it is very useful to set it.
The description is also visible in the autocomplete dropdown when you are categorizing transactions.

== Categorizing transactions

To categorize a transaction, navigate to the transaction overview page by clicking on the `Transactions` followed by `Income & Expense` in the sidebar.
This will open the transaction overview where all recorded transactions for a given month are visible.
In this guide we will create a new transaction to illustrate how to categorize it.

You will now be creating a new expense by clicking on the `Add transaction` button.
This will open a dropdown where you can click the `Add expense` button.

In the transaction form fill the following fields with some example data:

* `Date`: The date of the transaction.
* `Amount`: The amount of the transaction.
* `Description`: A description of the transaction.
* `Destination`: The account where the money is going to, this is an autocomplete field.

.The transaction create form

As you can see, the `Category` field is an autocomplete field, and it will automatically populate if 3 or more characters are typed.
The matching categories will be displayed in a list, containing both the name and the description of the category.
You can use either the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the list or use the mouse to select a category.

When you are done editing the transaction click the `Save` button to save the transaction.

== Categorization in the overview

After saving the transaction, you will see the transaction in the transaction overview.
In the figure below you can see the transaction you just created, with the category you selected.

It is important to understand the different pieces of information in this transaction view.

* The `Category` is visible in the green box in the transaction overview.
* The `Budget` is visible in the red box in the transaction overview.
* The `Tags` are visible in the purple box in the transaction overview, and look like pills.
