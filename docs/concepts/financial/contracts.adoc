A contract is a legally binding agreement that recognizes and governs the rights and duties of the parties to the agreement.

{application} enables you to add contracts, which then support:

- Linking all related transactions to the contract
- Record the physical contract (in PDF format)
- Warn you when the end date is near, so you can cancel in time if you wanted to stop the contract

Examples of contracts could be:

- Cable services
- Internet services
- Phone services
- Electricity utilities
