Since release 2.0.0 it is possible to install Personal Ledger as a standalone application for Windows 10.
Once installed it will automatically start the server and connect you to it.

WARNING: The standalone version of Personal Ledger is still experimental.
Make sure you back up the database regularly to prevent data-loss.

== Installation

At this time Java is not included in the {application} installer.
Follow the steps below to install Java 21:

1. Download the Java 21 installer from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions

=== Install {application}

To install the native Windows 10 application please follow the steps below:

1. Download the installer from the list below
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions
3. Follow the instructions in the next section to start the application

TIP: The standalone application will only run in H2 mode, so the database is stored on
your PC in the %appdata%\pledger-electron-app directory.

After the installer has finished a new application named '{application}' should have been added to the Windows menu.
