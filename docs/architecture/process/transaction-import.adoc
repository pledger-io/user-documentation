== Required variables

- `importJobSlug`,
the unique slug that was on the import job.
This can be obtained using the API.

== The business process

The transaction import process is interactive and has multiple points in time where the user is expected to provide information.
The following user tasks are in the process:

- `task_configure`,
this task will get activated after the import configuration is read to confirm it with the user.
- `confirm_mappings`,
this task will ask the user to confirm and adjust the mappings between account names in the CSV and the ones known in {application}.
- `user_create_account`,
this task can occur multiple times in during the import.
This will be triggered for each account in the CSV where no mapping was provided in the `confirm_mappings` task, but only if the feature that allows the process to create accounts is disabled.

=== User task: task_configure

This user task allows the user to change the configuration used during the CSV import.
Initially the user selected a pre-configured configuration, but this may be slightly outdated.
Or the user may wish to enable or disable automatic account creation.

==== Ingoing variables

- `initialConfig`, the default configuration used by the process.
This is loaded from the importer configuration settings known in {application}.

==== Outgoing variables

- `updatedConfig`, the updated configuration by the user.
This will be the version of the configuration that is actually used during the import process.

=== User task: confirm_mappings

This user task gives the user the opportunity to change the mapping between account names found in the CSV and ones already present in {application}.

==== Ingoing variables

- `account_mappings`, the mappings that {application} detected for itself using existing accounts.

==== Outgoing variables

- `account_mappings`, the updated mappings as they were set by the user.

=== User task: user_create_account

This user task is triggered when the user did not provide a mapping for an account in the `confirm_mappings` task and the feature to automatically create accounts is disabled.

==== Ingoing variables

- `accountName`, the name of the account that needs to be created.

==== Outgoing variables

- `accountId`, the ID of the account that was created.
