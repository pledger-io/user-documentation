Since release 2.0.0 it is possible to install Personal Ledger as a standalone application for Windows 10.
Once installed it will automatically start the server and connect you to it.

WARNING: The standalone version of Personal Ledger is still experimental.
Make sure you back up the database regularly to prevent data-loss.
