The account reconciliation process is a business process that is responsible for ensuring that the financial records are accurate and up-to-date.
To achieve this the starting and ending balance for a given year are compared and any discrepancies are resolved.

== Required variables

The following variables are required to be set in the process:

- `accountId`, the identifier of the account to be reconciled.
- `startDate`, the start date of the reconciliation period.
- `endDate`, the end date of the reconciliation period.
- `openBalance`, the opening balance of the account at the startDate.
- `endBalance`, the closing balance of the account at the endDate.

== The business process

Below is a business process model for the account reconciliation process.

=== User task: task_reconcile_before

This task will be triggered when the `openBalance` does not equal the computed balance at the `startDate`.
It indicates that the previous year must be reconciled before the current year can be continued.
Closing this task will re-calculate the balance at the `startDate`.
