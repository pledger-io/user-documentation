"Docker-compose" is a tool that can be used to bundle multiple containers into one single deployment.
When managing the images and volumes needed for {application} this method is preferred rather than single container runs.

== Create a compose file

A compose file describes how the deployment of the various images should happen.
To be able to deploy Personal Ledger you can use the compose file below as a template.

[source,yaml,linenums]
....
version: '3.7'
services:
    pledger:
      container_name: pledger
      image: ghcr.io/pledger-io/amd64-core:stable
      ports:
        - "80:8080"
      restart: unless-stopped
      environment:
        - DB_TYPE=mysql
        - DATABASE_HOST=pledger_db
        - DATABASE_SCHEMA=pledger
        - DATABASE_USER=pledger
        - DATABASE_PASSWORD=pledger
      volumes:
        - "pledger_logs:/opt/storage/logs"
        - "pledger_uploads:/opt/storage/upload"
    pledger_db:
      container_name: pledger_db
      image: mariadb:11.2
      volumes:
        - "pledger_db:/var/lib/mysql"
      environment:
        - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret
        - MYSQL_DATABASE=pledger
        - MYSQL_USER=pledger
        - MYSQL_PASSWORD=pledger

volumes:
  pledger_logs:
  pledger_uploads:
  pledger_db:
....

== Starting the deployment

Once the compose file is created you can start the deployment using the command below.

[source,shell,linenums]
....
docker-compose up -d
....

TIP: This command should be run in the same directory as the compose file.

This will start the deployment in the background.
You can check the status of the deployment using the command below.

[source,shell,linenums]
....
docker-compose ps
....

This will show the status of the deployment for each of the containers.
