TIP: The `Asset accounts` are those accounts that you own, such as your bank accounts, cash, and credit cards.
The `Liability accounts` are those accounts that you owe money on, such as loans and credit cards.
The `Expense accounts` are those accounts that you pay money to, while the `Revenue accounts` are those accounts that pay you money.

After this you will see the list of accounts that you have already created, see the image below.

Transactions are the financial activities that occur in your accounts, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

This will take you to the transaction overview page for that account.
On this page there are three buttons to create a new transaction, see the image below.

WARNING: If you are on the Expense or Revenue account overview page, you will see only one button to create an expense or a income.

By clicking on the `Add expense` button the transaction form will open.
In this form the source account will be a dropdown list with all your own accounts you have created.
The to account is a autocomplete field where you can start typing the name of the account you want to transfer the money to.
