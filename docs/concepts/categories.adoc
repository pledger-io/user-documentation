Categories are very similar to xref:budgets.adoc[budgets] in that they are both used to group similar transactions together.
For example 'lunch', 'interest', 'shoes' and 'candy' are very good categories, but would be terrible budgets.

Another key difference between the two is that categories can also be used to group income. For example:

- Salary
- Tax returns
- Declarations

== Difference between categories and budgets

If you have transactions that are monthly recurring, and you can save money on them then you should consider them as a budget and not a category.

Examples of this are:

- Groceries
- Entertainment (e.g. cable or Netflix)

If a transaction is occasionally then it should not be a budget itself.
A category is used to group transactions that happen 'incidental'.
Another reason to prefer a category over a budget is when you do not care about the costs.

== Managing categories

On the category overview all the categories are listed that are available in {application} for the current user.
You can reach the overview by clicking the `Categories` option in the side navigation.
Here you have the option to add new categories, update existing ones or remove no longer needed categories.
