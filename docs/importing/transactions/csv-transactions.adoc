Various banks support downloading a transaction statement as a CSV file.
Using the CSV import you can import these statements into {application}.

== Starting an import

Adding a new CSV import is achieved by visiting the `Import Transactions` option in the sidebar of {application}.
This will load the historic run import list, which displays any previously run imports.

You can choose to `Apply configured rules`, this will run all transaction rules and update the transaction accordingly.
For faster importing disable this feature.

== Column mappings

In the column mappings phase each column can be changed to match a detail field in the transaction for {application}.

When you do not want a column to be processed into the transaction select the
`Ignore option`.

== Account matching

Account mappings allow you to select the existing account to match an account name of the import file with.
If you do not specify an account in this screen it will either throw an exception if you did not select `Automatically create missing accounts` option in the xref:_import_settings[Import settings] screen or create the account if you did.

Once the import is completed you can access the detail overview of the import by clicking it in the list view.
This detail overview will provide you a summary of the transactions in the imported file.
As well as a complete list of all transactions that were imported.
