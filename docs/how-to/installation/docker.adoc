Running {application} using docker is an easy way to get started.
Just execute a few lines, and you are up and running.

There are several ways to get started with {application} using Docker, each one detailed below.
If you are new to Docker or are not sure as to how to use it then ask for advice.

== Supported tags

Personal Ledger uses the docker tagging system to release multiple versions.
There are various builds for various different target platforms.

Personal Ledger is currently built for:

- AMD64, under image `{docker-image}`
- ARMv8, under image `ghcr.io/pledger-io/arm64-core`

The instructions here will assume usage of the tag `stable`.
Other tags that are used are:

- `ghcr.io/pledger-io/<architecture>-core:stable`, this tag will always point to the latest release that was run
-  `ghcr.io/pledger-io/<architecture>-core:x.x.x`, these are version specific tags.

Currently, only AMD-64 and ARM64 builds are available in the official docker hub.

== Single container

These instructions will help you set up a standalone container in docker running only
{application}.
Please note that dependent images, like MySQL, are not included in this sample.
Running the single container can be useful when debugging or testing the application.

WARNING: It is advised to set up a separate container with link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb[MariaDB].

=== Creating the volumes

{application} uses various storage locations in the container to store user data.
It is advised to create one volume for each of the type of storage that the application uses.

[source,shell,linenums]
....
docker volume create pledger_logs
docker volume create pledger_upload
....

=== Starting the container

You can use the command below to start the container with {application}.
Make sure to edit any environment variables to match your setup.

[source,shell,linenums]
....
 docker run -d \
         -v pledger_logs:/opt/storage/logs \
         -v pledger_uploads:/opt/storage/upload \
         -p 8080:8080 \
         --name pledger \
         -e DB_TYPE=mysql
         -e DATABASE_HOST=mariadb
         -e DATABASE_SCHEMA=pledger
         -e DATABASE_USER=pledger
         -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=pledger
         ghcr.io/pledger-io/amd64-core:stable
....

Once this command is run a docker container with {application} will start, this may take some time when run the first time.
The application will automatically attempt to update the database to the version running.
After {application} is started you can access the interface using:

> http://localhost:8080
