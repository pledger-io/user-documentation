The configuration is an essential part of the import of transactions, as this indicates what
columns in the CSV contain which information for the transaction.

Adding a new CSV configuration is achieved by visiting the `Import Transactions` option
in the sidebar of {application}.
This will load the historic run import list, which displays any previously run imports.

TIP: You can download predefined configuration in the link:https://bitbucket.org/jongsoftdev/fintrack-importer-configuration[fintrack-importer-configuration] repository.

In this list view you can then click the `Add new import` to system button at the top of the list.
This will open the import window. For adding a new configuration you should select the `Add new configuration` link in the window.

Select a file using the button or drag one onto the drop-zone.
