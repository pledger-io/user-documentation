A contract is a legally binding agreement that recognizes and governs the rights and duties of the parties to the agreement.

{application} enables you to add contracts, which then support:

- Linking all related transactions to the contract
- Record the physical contract (in PDF format)
- Warn you when the end date is near, so you can cancel in time if you wanted to stop the contract

Examples of contracts could be:

- Cable services
- Internet services
- Phone services
- Electricity utilities

== Managing contracts

Contracts are split up into two separate groups.
Those that are active, and those that have been archived (e.g.: expired and canceled contracts).
Below is a screenshot of the overview page.

== Editing a contract

Adding or editing a contract can be done easily by either clicking the `Add contract` button, or the edit icon:square-edit[] icon on the overview page.
You will then be presented with a form allowing you to enter the details of the contract.

.Contract edit form

On this edit form you need to enter the `Name` of the contract as well as the contractual period.
In the `Company` field you will need to select the `Credit account` that is linked to the contract.

== Uploading PDF

Usually you will receive either a digital copy or physical copy of the contract from your service provider.
You can upload this copy to {application}, so you can access it at a later time.
To do this press the icon:upload[] icon in the contract overview page.
This will open the upload dialog to select a PDF file for the contract.

In the dialog select the file that is the copy of your contract and click on `Save` to start the upload.

== Warning before contract expire date

With most contracts if you want to terminate it you have to do this one month in advance.
{application} can aid you with an e-mail reminder one month before the provided end date of the contract.
This feature can be activated for each contract separately by clicking the icon:calendar-check[] icon on the contract overview page.

WARNING: Please note that for {application} to be able to send the e-mail you must have the mail settings configured first.
See the installation notes on how to do this.
