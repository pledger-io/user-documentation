The user interface is a React-based application.
It is built up using the following frameworks and tools:

- link:https://reactjs.org/[React],
used as the UI framework.
- link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript],
used as the programming language.
- link:https://www.chartjs.org/[Chart.js],
used for the rendering of the various charts inside the application.
- link:https://primereact.org/[Primereact],
used as the primary UI component library for the application.
- link:https://axios-http.com/docs/intro[axios],
used for the communication with the REST-api.

== Overview

The Pledger.io application follows a layered architecture pattern,
separating concerns into distinct layers that interact with each other in a controlled manner.
This document describes the high-level architecture of the application, including its main layers and components.

== Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Pledger.io application:

.Front-end layers
[.scalable-image]
[plantuml, generated/architecture/ui-design, png]
....
include::{document-root}/images/diagrams/ui_architecture.puml[]
....

As can be seen, there is one main entry point the user interacts with, the `Pledger.io` component.

Each `page` is represented in a `route`, but multiple routes can lead to the same `page`.
Every `page` can consist out of multiple `components`.

The `components` and `pages` can use the `repository` layer to access the backend application.

== Architectural Layers

=== Entry Points

* *index.jsx*: The main entry point of the application that bootstraps the React application.
* *pledger-io.tsx*: The main application component that sets up the application context and routing.

=== Pages

Pages are React components that represent full screens in the application.
They include:

* *Dashboard Page*: The main landing page showing an overview of the user's financial status.
* *Login/Register Pages*: Authentication pages for user login and registration.
* *Account Pages*: Pages for managing financial accounts.
* *Budget Pages*: Pages for creating and managing budgets.
* *Transaction Pages*: Pages for viewing, creating, and managing transactions.
* *Contract Pages*: Pages for managing recurring financial contracts.
* *Report Pages*: Pages for generating and viewing financial reports.
* *Automation Pages*: Pages for setting up and managing automation rules.
* *Settings Pages*: Pages for configuring application settings.

=== Components

Components are reusable UI elements that are used across multiple pages.
They include:

* *Layout Components*: Components for page layout, such as headers, footers, and navigation.
* *Form Components*: Reusable form elements and validation.
* *Account Components*: Components specific to account management.
* *Budget Components*: Components for budget visualization and management.
* *Transaction Components*: Components for transaction listing, filtering, and editing.
* *Contract Components*: Components for contract management.
* *Report Components*: Components for report generation and visualization.
* *Upload Components*: Components for file uploading.
* *Dashboard Components*: Components for the dashboard, such as summary cards and charts.

=== Repositories

Repositories provide a clean abstraction for data access, following the Repository pattern.
They include:

* *Account Repository*: Handles operations related to financial accounts.
* *Budget Repository*: Handles operations related to budgets.
* *Category Repository*: Handles operations related to transaction categories.
* *Contract Repository*: Handles operations related to financial contracts.
* *Rule Repository*: Handles operations related to automation rules.
* *Security Repository*: Handles operations related to authentication and authorization.
* *Profile Repository*: Handles operations related to user profiles.
* *Statistical Repository*: Handles operations related to financial statistics and reports.
* *Savings Repository*: Handles operations related to savings goals.
* *Process Repository*: Handles operations related to background processes.
* *Import Job Repository*: Handles operations related to importing financial data.
