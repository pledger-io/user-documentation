== Required variables

*Generic variables that are required for the scheduling process:*

* `subProcess` - the name of the sub-process that is triggered by the scheduled transaction.
For this process, the sub-process is `ScheduledTransaction`.
* `start` - the start date for the schedule.
* `end` - the end date for the schedule.
* `interval` - the interval between the scheduled transactions.
* `periodicity` - the frequency of the scheduled transactions.

*Specif variables needed for the scheduled transaction process:*

* `ScheduledTransaction` - a map with the settings for the sub-process.
** `id` - the unique identifier for the scheduled transaction.

== The business process

A scheduled transaction is a business process that is modeled as a scheduled event.
The event is triggered by a scheduled date and time.
The reoccurrence of the event is determined by the interval and periodicity of the scheduled transaction.

This process re-uses the generic process scheduler BPMN flow to trigger the start of the more specific scheduled transaction process.
