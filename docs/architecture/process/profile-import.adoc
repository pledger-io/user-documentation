This process is responsible for importing user profiles exported from other installations into the running {application}.

The import is JSON based and adheres to the link:{schema-location}/profile.schema.json[user profile JSON schema].
This schema can contain any of the following:

- Accounts
- Categories
- Contacts
- Transaction rules
- Budgets
- Transaction tags

[NOTE]
====
The process will first import the core entities (accounts, categories, budgets and tags) followed by the contracts and any transaction rules.

This is due to the fact that both contracts and transaction rules can reference the core entities.
